Hard to follow\n\n\nLILY: This is a challenge I have with Prolog so far, I think we spoke about it at a very early point. I am not sure how to specificy where predicates come from, other than pre-appending the filename/module in the predicate name, though I feel this becomes messy quite quickly.

The predicates could be moved into this file, though it I prefer it in a seperate file due to the statement_handler curating which predicates require to be called rather than doing it here (With exceptions if they are minimal in size.
